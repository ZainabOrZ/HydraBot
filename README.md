# HydraBot
My programming NoobStruggles

This is the same project from https://github.com/ZainabOrZ/MultiUserBot . This was created to better document the changes I will try to implement from now on.

# What I ultimatiey want: 
One central bot that will respond to a particular channel on twitch using several different user accounts. I would like to automate my part in the stream by haing the "bots" respond for me. For example when the phase "Help fight him by typing !raid" is entered in the chat, I want to bot to recognize it then respond with !raid from all six profiles

# What is happening so far: 
The code and program works exactly the way it is supposed to when one user is in the code. After I add the other 5 profiles i run node index.js again and I receive an error stating that the bot can not send anonymous messages.
